# nu-blender

A work-in-progress, modern Blender add-on that adds import support for scene files (`.nup`) from the PC version of *LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game*.

## Building

Before building the add-on, make sure to add the Blender installation directory to your `PATH`. Then follow the instructions [located here](build/README.md).
